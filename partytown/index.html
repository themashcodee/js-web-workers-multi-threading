					This calculation would be perform on second thread with the help of
					web worker. We dont have DOM access in the web workers. But Partytown
					enables DOM access in web workers in a genius way. It is for
					off-loading third party scripts which are not directly playing a vital
					role in the product such as Google Analytics. Partytown is not for
					every type of purpose and also it is in beta as of 9 April, 2022.
